# raspiBackup - Backup and restore your running Raspberries

* Create an unattended full system backup with no shutdown of the system or any other manual intervention just by starting raspiBackup using cron. Important services can be stopped before starting the backup and are started again when the backup finished.
* Any device mountable on Linux can be used as backupspace (local USB disk, remote nfs drive, remote samba share, remote ssh server using sshfs, remote ftp server using curlftpfs, webdav drive using davfs, ...).
* Standard Linux backup tools dd, tar and rsync can be used to create the backup.
* An external rootpartition and Raspberry 3/4 USB boot images are supported.
* Status of backup run can be sent via eMail or to Telegram
* Apply a smart recycle backup strategy (save backups of last 7 days, last 4 weeks, last 12 months and last n years) - also known as grandfather, father and son backup rotation principle
* UI installer configures all major options to get raspiBackup up and running in 5 minutes
* Much more features ... (See doc below)

## Miscellaneous tools and utilities [(Code)](https://github.com/framps/raspiBackup/tree/master/helper)

* Sample wrapper scripts to add any activities before and after backup [(Code)](https://github.com/framps/raspiBackup/blob/master/helper/raspiBackupWrapper.sh)

* Sample wrapper script which checks whether a nfsserver is online, mounts one exported directory and invokes raspiBackup. If the nfsserver is not online no backup is started. [(Code)](https://github.com/framps/raspiBackup/blob/master/helper/raspiBackupNfsWrapper.sh)

* Script which restores an existing tar or rsync backup created by raspiBackup into an image file and then shrinks the image with [pishrink](https://github.com/Drewsif/PiShrink). Result is the smallest possible dd image backup. When this image is restored via dd or windisk32imager it's expanding the root partition to the maximum possible size. [(Code)](https://github.com/framps/raspiBackup/blob/master/helper/raspiBackupRestore2Image.sh)

## Sample extensions [(Code)](https://github.com/framps/raspiBackup/tree/master/extensions)
* Sample eMail extension
* Sample pre/post extension which reports the memory usage before and after backup
* Sample pre/post extension which reports the CPU temperatur before and after backup
* Sample pre/post extension which reports the disk usage on the backup partition before and after backup and the absolute and relative change
* Sample pre/post extension which initiates different actions depending on the return code of raspiBackup
* Sample ready extension which copies /etc/fstab into the backup directory

## Systemd

Instead of cron systemd can be used to start raspiBackup. See [here](installation/systemd) (thx [Hofei](https://github.com/Hofei90)) for details.

# REST API Server proof of concept

Allows to start raspiBackup from a remote system or any web UI.
1. Download executable from [RESTAPI directory](https://github.com/framps/raspiBackup/tree/master/RESTAPI)
2. Create a file /usr/local/etc/raspiBackup.auth and define access credentials for the API. For every user create a line userid:password
3. Set file attributes for /usr/local/etc/raspiBackup.auth to 600
4. Start the RESTAPI with ```sudo raspiBackupRESTAPIListener```. Option -a can be used to define another listening port than :8080.
5. Use ```curl -u userid:password -H "Content-Type: application/json" -X POST -d '{"target":"/backup","type":"tar", "keep": 3}' http://<raspiHost>:8080/v0.1/backup``` to kick off a backup.
